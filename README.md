# MadGeniusChallenge


The objective of this project was to duplicate a UI composition provided by a company known as Mad Genius. They supplied the visual assets and requested that I reconstruct their design with functional elements, using any suitable programming languages or frameworks. For this purpose, I employed Next.js and Tailwind technologies. In the case of the company logo, as an image wasn't supplied, I captured a screenshot of the logo. To achieve the desired effect of the image below the navigation bar, I utilized overflow hidden to trim a portion of the picture, mirroring the style presented in the UI composition. For the trio of images positioned underneath, I transformed them into cards and integrated buttons within the card design.
